# Users & Notes API

A RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL using Sequelize as the ORM. This API allows you to perform CRUD operations on users and their notes, with a one-to-many relationship between users and notes.

## Features

- User management (CRUD operations)
- Note management (CRUD operations)
- One-to-many relationship between users and notes
- Interactive web interface for testing API endpoints
- Sequelize ORM for database operations
- PostgreSQL database

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- PostgreSQL database
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Larsbuilds/Users-Notes-API-Learn-Test-Explore.git
cd Users-Notes-API-Learn-Test-Explore
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```
PG_URI=postgres://your_username:your_password@localhost:5432/your_database
PORT=3000
```

4. Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## API Endpoints

## üåê Deployment

### Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

1. **Connect to Netlify**
   - Fork this repository to your GitHub account
   - Log in to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose GitHub and select your forked repository

2. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Build command: Leave empty (no build command needed)
   - Publish directory: `public`
   - Click "Deploy site"

### Backend Deployment Options

You can deploy the Node.js backend on any of these platforms that work well with Neon:

1. **Railway** (Recommended)
   - Visit [Railway.app](https://railway.app/)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Add your Neon database URL as an environment variable
   - Railway will automatically deploy your Node.js application
   - Free tier available for hobby projects

2. **Render**
   - Visit [Render.com](https://render.com/)
   - Create a new Web Service
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Add environment variables:
     ```
     PG_URI=your_neon_connection_string
     ```
   - Free tier available

3. **Heroku**
   - Install [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
   - Login and create a new app:
     ```bash
     heroku login
     heroku create your-app-name
     ```
   - Set environment variables:
     ```bash
     heroku config:set PG_URI=your_neon_connection_string
     ```
   - Deploy:
     ```bash
     git push heroku main
     ```
   - Note: Requires credit card for free tier

### Connecting Frontend to Backend

1. **Update API URL**
   - Once your backend is deployed, get your backend URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
   - Update the `API_URL` in `public/index.html`:
     ```javascript
     const API_URL = 'https://your-backend-url';
     ```

2. **Configure CORS**
   - Add your Netlify domain to your backend's CORS configuration
   - Example CORS configuration:
     ```javascript
     app.use(cors({
       origin: 'https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app'
     }));
     ```

### Important Notes
- Ensure your backend service has CORS properly configured
- Update your Neon database security settings to allow connections from your chosen backend host
- Keep your environment variables secure and never commit them to version control
- Consider using environment-specific configuration for development and production

## üí° Usage Example

Creating a new blog post:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "My First Post",
    "author": "John Doe",
    "content": "Hello, World!"
  }'
```

## üìä Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
